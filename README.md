# BlockchainWallets
## Description

The goal is to create a Streamlit application where a user will be able to hire a blockchain professional to complete some tasks. The user will be able to create a transaction and send ether to the blockchain professional based on the amount of work they need to be done.

## Installation Guide

The user will need to install Streamlit to host the application and Ganache to create a test Blockchain wallet. Ganache will need to be directly downloaded from the website.
```

```

To run this application, please navigate to the Blockchain directory and run the following command
```
